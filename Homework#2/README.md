# Gross Pay Calculator and Math Class Practice with Absolute Value, Exponents, and Square Root<br>
The purpose of the Gross Pay program is to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.<br>
Three Doubles (X, Y, Z) - This program prompts the user to input three numbers for x, y, and z. This program will calculate the following:<br>
<ul>
<li> x raised to the power of z </li>
<li> x raised to the power of (y to the power of z) </li>
<li> absolute value of y </li>
<li> square root of (x*y to the power of z) </li>
</ul>
